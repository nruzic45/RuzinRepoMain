2. An aplication that performed data analysis gathered in real time from an arduino with an accelerometer. The aplication had
  a simple GUI made in python that represented gathered data; a calibration module and a calculation module. The python backend was implemented
  using two threads, one that supported the GUI, and one that calculated roll, pitch and yaw of the arduino and some I/O opperations.
